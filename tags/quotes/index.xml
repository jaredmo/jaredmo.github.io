      <description>Slate has an article from Ken Jennings talking about his match this week against IBM&amp;rsquo;s Watson Supercomputer. This was my favorite quote.&#xA;So my defeat at the hands of a machine has a happy ending, after all. At least until the whole system becomes sentient and figures out the nuclear launch codes. But I figure that&amp;rsquo;s years away.&#xA;Pretty soon we&amp;rsquo;ll all need some Old Glory Insurance.</description>

      <description>But corporations can go bust as often as they like, thus subsidizing us consumers by transferring their wealth into our pockets - the more bankruptcies, the better it is for us. Government is a more serious business and we need to make sure we do not pay the price for its folly. As individuals we should love free markets because operators in them can be as incompetent as they wish.</description>

      <description>This is a war universe. War all the time. That is its nature. There may be other universes based on all sorts of other principles, but ours seems to be based on war and games.&#xA;-William S. Burroughs, Grand Street, No. 37 (1991)</description>
