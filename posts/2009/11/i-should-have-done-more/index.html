      <div class="post-content">
        
        <p>Listened to a podcast this afternoon from &ldquo;This American Life&rdquo; entitled <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1318"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Return to the Giant Pool of Money&rdquo;</a>. The series&rsquo; first episode contains the best explanation of last fall&rsquo;s financial meltdown I have heard. The &ldquo;return&rdquo; was equally informative. While the podcast contained interviews with many different players, the most interesting character, in my opinion, was Glen.</p>
<p>Glen was a mortgage company sales manager during the boom. He stated in the first part of the series that during the good times he was netting upwards of 75-100K per month in income. Not per year. Per month.</p>
<p>However, within a year, he had lost it all. Glen is open about his fall and recognizes the irony of his situation. The interviewer makes the observation that he &ldquo;sounds like a man on the verge of a major life change&rdquo;. In one of the interviews most poignant moments, Glen starts to get emotional and says he is ashamed of what the money did to him. He &ldquo;should have done more&rdquo; to help people when he had the money, but he didn&rsquo;t. Glen only cared about Glen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving a car with no paint on it, and I used to think that it mattered&hellip;.but it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment reminded me of Schindler&rsquo;s List when Oskar Schindler recognizes at the end of the film, that people, not things, are most important. Sometimes it takes a fall to learn life&rsquo;s fundamental truths. Take a listen. It&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
