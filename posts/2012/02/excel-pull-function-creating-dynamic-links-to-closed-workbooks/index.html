        <p>I was working on a project this week that required aggregation of data from many, many different Excel workbooks (and various tabs within those workbooks) into one unified dashboard. Now, this can be accomplished with traditional linking, but anyone who has tried to link more than a few workbooks together will tell you this is a pain to maintain and often not very reliable.</p>
<p>One useful function for creating dynamic links within the same workbook is <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/indirect-HP005209139.aspx">INDIRECT</a>. Instead of hardcoding cell and worksheet references into a formula, INDIRECT allows pieces of a formula to be dynamically updated using variables. Sounds pretty good right? Well, INDIRECT has an Achilles’ heel. It only works if you are linking within the same workbook. Need dynamic links to a closed workbook? Bill Gates says, &ldquo;You're out of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, after searching around, I found an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!msg/microsoft.public.excel.worksheet.functions/l9ObQ9ku6Bk/_a2jdMD2SeIJ">old Usenet post from 2004</a> by a fellow named Harlan Grove. He wrote an Excel function in VB called PULL which essentially fixes INDIRECT's fatal flaw and allows the user to create links to closed workbooks. Just copy the code below into a Module within the workbook of your choice. Then you can use the PULL function just like any other.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
<code>A1 = C:\work\</code><br>
<code>B1 = data\</code><br>
<code>C1 = \[ClosedBook.xls\]Sheet1'!$A</code><br>
<code>E1 = PULL(&quot;'&quot;&amp;A1&amp;B1&amp;C1)</code></p>

<p>There's a newer version at <a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/L_eA8s4G/pull.html">http://www.4shared.com/file/L_eA8s4G/pull.html</a> I'd make the same caveats I made in my newsgroup postings: the pull udf is SLOW, so you want to use it sparingly. I intentionally made it nonvolatile. If the file would be closed on your computer but someone else has it open and is saving changes, you may think you want it to be volatile, but Excel is a poor tool to use for this sort of data capture. Multiuser databases are much better. If you really, really must make it volatile, use it in formulas like =IF(NOW(),pull(&hellip;)) most general but limited =pull(&hellip;)+0*NOW() if you're certain it'll return numbers =pull(&hellip;)&amp;T(NOW()) if you're certain it'll return text</p>

<p>This is great, but, in Excel 2010, it has a problem with textual data. All numeric-type data comes over fine, but anything with text, it returns a &ldquo;#N/A&rdquo; error. Other than that works beautifully!!!</p>

<p>Harlan Thanks for creating the pull. However, i need to tweak it slightly. I am using it on an excel where the pull is happening from another file on my system. Now when I email this excel, the pull results in a REF, as the other person does not have the file to pull the data from. Now, vlookup like functions give you an option, to update links, and if you choose not to update links, it stores the values as it had. A solution to my problem can be if pull can have a similar functionality. Another solution can be I create a macro to paste special values of all cells using the pull. I will have to either manually trigger it or something. Any advice, or solutions you may have? Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Harlan I develop &ldquo;one off&rdquo; tools for a team of analysts to help save them from spreadsheet hell. I have been migrating to excel over the years but I started out in 123. I still have some 123 aps in use and I catch hell from the current MS generation. I have never found an equivalent for what I call &ldquo;SQL in a cell&rdquo; (retrieving data from multiple external database files using @dget or @dsum) I also use Lotus Approach RDBM. Do you have any new insights into doing this in Excel without getting into exotic VB programs. Example of a typical ap I have external data files (in db4) for: backlog of orders, finished goods, intransit products, forecast, etc , all of these keyed by Part number and dates User open a 123 spreadsheet template I developed 123 spreadsheet with columns for all the above variables and cell formulas with the @ functions and col to col foemulas. All they have to do: Part numbers are pasted in by user in col A They click one macro button and in 5-10 minutes all the data is retrieved. Another macro copies/paste as values to a 2nd worksheet and they are done. I have goggled this on and off and searched several forums to no avail. When I do post I get the usual dsum, sumif suggestions. I have tried using VB to open and walk through the tables row by row but it takes forever. Any way. If you've spent the time to read all this I really appreciate it. Any help you can give me would be appreciated.

<p>Guys - none of you has, obviously, heard of Laurent Longre's Morefunc add-in, which includes the INDIRECT.EXT function. This modified function enables you to create volatile links to closed workbooks. I've used it extensively.</p>

<p>Rock'n'roll! It works perfectly. In case somebody is as dumb as I am: it will not work when you copy =PULL(“‘”&amp;A1&amp;B1&amp;C1) from the website right into your spreadsheet. Because Excel does not know what these funny typographic quotation marks are, you would need to use =PULL(&quot;'&quot;&amp;A1&amp;B1&amp;C1). Took me 10 minutes to find out what the propblem was :-(, - now it works perfectly :-) thanks!!</p>

<p>Hi there. I'm currently trying to get the pull function to work as well. First thanks for the great work already accomplished! I experienced the first chunk of code to work as it is posted on this blog when simply copying it as a new module in the excel - macro enabled- file. The second version of it, the .xla file will not work for me though, the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; function calls are replaced by #NAME? instead. The macro is enabled though when I look at File -&gt; Options -&gt; Complements, &ldquo;HG's own add-in&rdquo;. I have the feeling, Excel does not recognize the function correctly. Autocompletion works though. Any suggestion ?</p>

<p>Hi, Could someone please help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? Here's what I have: Cell B1= &lsquo;C:\Users\Cristina\Documents\My Dropbox\Cristina\Evaluacion Automatica de Pruebas\Evaluacion 6 Necesidades\Participantes\[Encuesta Necesidades S1P01.xlsx]Sheet1&rsquo;!$D9 =PULL(&quot;'&quot;&amp;B$1) I already tried the suggestion given above about doing the following and it is not working (except I cannot make excel not put a coma at the beginning of Cell B1 - I erase it and it keeps putting it back). So it looks like this: Cell B1= &lsquo;Users\Cristina\Documents\My Dropbox\Cristina\Evaluacion Automatica de Pruebas\Evaluacion 6 Necesidades\Participantes\[Encuesta Necesidades S1P01.xlsx]Sheet1&rsquo;!$D9 =PULL(&quot;&lsquo;C:\&quot;&amp;B$1) Still not working..

<p>I found a much easier way to do this. The goal is to access data from closed workbooks using dynamic links, whereas INDIRECT won't work on a closed workbook. But you can still use dynamic links. You just have to go through the Name Manager and create a universal reference name. In the workbook I created, I use the drop down box cell link value to reference an array and piece together the cell reference I want. From there, what people are typically wont to do is use that constructed cell reference with INDIRECT in their formulas (× who knows how many formulas). Instead, I used a vba sub routine to rewrite the value of a name in the Name Manager, and I used the name as a variable in my formulas. So I might have in one of my cells the formula: =nV(VLOOKUP($E9,SN,3)) E9 is the date code reference, which I use as a key on my data table, SN is the variable named range, and 3 is the column in that range. (nV is a custom function I built that returns either a blank cell or the value you choose if the criteria equals &ldquo;&quot;, 0, or an Error). The name SN in the Name Manager has the value: ='https://d.docs.live.net/ed2bad18b7a35798/Public/[DT6438.xlsm]Data Table&rsquo;!$A$5:$DH$35 (I altered some numbers for security). When I change the drop down box to another selection, it reconstructs the reference with the correct file name according to the array, and the correct range of cells according to the specified month on the sheet. Using the array, the code looks like this: =nV(CONCATENATE(&quot;&lsquo;<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/ed2bad18b7a35798/Public/">https://d.docs.live.net/ed2bad18b7a35798/Public/</a>[&quot;,VLOOKUP(CJ1,CJ2:CL24,3),&quot;.xlsm]Data Table&rsquo;!&quot;,&ldquo;$A$&rdquo;,(DATE(VLOOKUP(D38,C1:D37,2),B13,1)-41635),&quot;:$DH$&rdquo;,EOMONTH(DATE(VLOOKUP(D38,C1:D37,2),B13,1),0)-41635)) Since the source files are all in the same drive, they all share <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/ed2bad18b7a35798/Public/">https://d.docs.live.net/ed2bad18b7a35798/Public/</a> in common. This could be individually specified if necessary, if the files were in different drives. The VLOOKUP is checking the array. CJ1 is the drop down box cell reference. CJ2:CL24 is the array range. 3 is the column in the array where the file name is found. The specific cell reference range is built based on the date entered on the main sheet drop down box. It gives a range from the first day of the month to the last day of the month, using date codes minus the correct amount to equal the actual row number for the cell reference. The date code for January 1st, 2014, for example, is 41640. That date is row 5 in the data table. Ergo, DATE(2014,1,1)-41635, or 41640 minus 41635. The A and DH column parameters are just the full width of my data range on the data table. Once the reference is built, a vba Sub generates a variable out of the constructed reference and overwrites the value of SN in the Name Manager with this code: Sub Change_Reference() New_Ref = Sheets(&ldquo;Data Sheet&rdquo;).Range(&ldquo;CJ26&rdquo;) ActiveWorkbook.Names(&ldquo;SN&rdquo;).RefersTo = &ldquo;=&rdquo; &amp; New_Ref End Sub I have 992 cells using the SN reference, pulling over 100 pieces of data from 20 separate stores on a remote drive. The file size is currently 201 KB. It works. It works beautifully. It works quickly. And it's memory efficient. Relative to the requests for help I've seen across the web, not merely on the INDIRECT function, but INDIRECT in this specific application, I hope this is helpful to someone.</p>

<p>Thanks Alex, with that I was able to figure out some of it. The thing I still can't figure out is how you handle multiple workbooks. Do you have a different &ldquo;Name&rdquo; for each cell*workbook value? For example, if I have 3 workbooks each with 20 values to be imported, do I have to have 60 &ldquo;Names&rdquo; (workbook1cell1, workbook2cell1, workbook3cell1, workbook1cell2, etc.?) The thing I am trying to accomplish is essentially pull in 100 cells worth of data each from a series of workbooks that are all set up exactly the same just by changing the cell that contains the reference to the workbook.</p>

<p>It's great that there is a function like this user defined pull function. Although, while user defined functions are working in my excel 2003 on a winxp machine, I haven't been able to get the pull function UDF to work. I opened a new excel spreadsheet (a .xls file) and opened up the VBE, chose &lsquo;insert module&rsquo;, then copied the pull function UDF (from the original post of this thread) to &lsquo;module 1&rsquo;. Then exited VBE. Then I did a test, by putting the number &lsquo;4&rsquo; in cell E1, and the number &lsquo;3&rsquo; in cell E4. I then firstly put =INDIRECT(&ldquo;E&rdquo;&amp;E1) into cell A1, which resulted in a &lsquo;3&rsquo; in cell A1. Then I put =pull(&ldquo;E&rdquo;&amp;E1) into cell A2, which resulted in #REF! in cell A2. I actually want to use the pull function for external worksheets, but I first needed to see if the pull function works within its own local spreadsheet to start with. Other user defined functions are working on my system, and I'm trying to get this pull function to work (and it has been correctly copied to &lsquo;module 1&rsquo;). I would love to get this one to work because this would be a very nice feature to have. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi harlan grove, This function is slow for only one reason. The Set xlapp = CreateObject(&ldquo;Excel.Application&rdquo;) has been defined in the function, which creates a new object every time a cell is changed. We need to initialize it only once. So you can just declare - - public xlapp as object - - in the module just above the line - - Function pull(xref As String) As Variant and PUT THE - - Set xlapp = CreateObject(&ldquo;Excel.Application&rdquo;) within workbook_open event under THISWORKBOOK. Believe me it works awesome. I have tried it and pulled 100 rows each from 20 files in 15 seconds. I can send you my excel files which are working with awesome speed. Please give me your email id.

<p>Clayton, I apologize, but the only examples I have are company spreadsheets. I'm not at liberty to share them with the public. But I'll do the best I can to be less technical and explain this a little better. If you were to piece together a cell reference for use in an INDIRECT command, you might have &ldquo;A&rdquo; in A1 and &ldquo;27&rdquo; in B1, so that you can build the cell reference &ldquo;A27&rdquo; in C1 with a formula like =A1 &amp; B1. Then in D1 you could use the formula =INDIRECT(C1), which would return, not the value A27, but the value OF A27. The values of &ldquo;A&rdquo; in A1 and &ldquo;27&rdquo; in B1 may change depending on other formulas you have, so that INDIRECT(C1) might return the value of A27, or D32, or whatever. That's the power of the INDIRECT command. What most people are trying to do is use it to access closed workbooks or workbooks on remote servers, which INDIRECT simply will not do. What you CAN do is use a file or web path, with workbook and cell reference directly in your formula to retrieve the information you want. But this is not variable. If you have something set up to manage multiple stores, like I do, then you might want the same value from the same cell, but across ten or twelve workbooks. That means you have to either change your formulas, write a lengthy, complicated script that rewrites your formulas, or you have to find a way to make INDIRECT work on remote workbooks &hellip; which, again, just can't be done. So what I did was use a Name in my formulas. In the Name Manager, you can create a Name that stands in place of a value, formula, or whatever you need it to stand in place of. The value of the Name Manager is that if you have a repeated, lengthy formula in numerous cells, you can clear up the congestion by creating a Name that IS the formula. And as fate would have it, a Name that stands in place of a file or web path, complete with workbook and cell reference, works just fine in a formula. As fate would also have it, a simple vb script can rewrite that single Name reference. So what you have to do is create a list of file or web paths and build your cell reference, just as in the example of building a cell reference for INDIRECT. Then have vb take the value of that cell (vb doesn't distinguish between a constructed reference and a bonafide reference) and have it rewrite what the Name you've created refers to. Like so: Sub Change_Reference() New_Ref = Sheets(“Sheet”).Range(“Cell″) ActiveWorkbook.Names(“Name”).RefersTo = “=” &amp; New_Ref End Sub New_Ref takes its value from the sheet and cell you specify. Then the Name you specify in the active workbook you're using is made to refer to the new value you've specified for New_Ref. It's really quite simple once you see it work.</p>

<p>If you want the 100 cells worth of values all on the same page at the same time, then each workbook you are referencing would need its own name. The purpose of the name is to allow variables. If you change the value the name represents, it changes the data you retrieve. If you have 100 specific cells you want to pull information from in a specific sheet, you can access that data directly. If the 100 cells you pull data from change within that sheet due to variables, you need to use a name so you can dynamically alter the cells you are retrieving data from, since INDIRECT won't work on closed workbooks stored on a remote drive. If you are pulling up data from one workbook at a time, then you only need a single name. When you rewrite the name's reference value, you can change both the workbook it refers to and the cells it retrieves at the same time. Just think of the indirect command and how it would be done if the command worked the way we want it to. You would piece together the drive, file name, etc., and you would piece together the cell reference. Then you would put them together using the INDIRECT command to access the data you want. For this method, build the reference the very same way. Then use vb to rewrite the reference value of the NAME to the fully constructed reference you've created.</p>

<p>Pappu, I know that this post is years old, but I would really appreciate it if you could further explain how to get your alterations working in this code. I simply don't understand how it works in conjunction with the pull code. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi I cant get the function to run. There are 2 lines that are giving compile errors. While (Left(Right(filename, count), 1) “\”) While (Left(Right(file, count), 1) “]”) Would someone be able to help?</p>

<p>Pappu, are there any other details? I can't seem to get the pull function to work with your proposed changes, and at the moment it is might slow&hellip; Thanks</p>

<p>I had the same issue. When I copy/pasted I got different characters for double quotes, single quotes, and minus signs than what I get when I type those on my keyboard. I ran a search and replace for those three characters and now it works for me.</p>

<p>I had the same issue. I had to run a search and replace to convert the double quotes, single quotes, and minus signs to the characters I get from my keyboard. When I copy/pasted from the post above I got different symbols than the standard for those three.</p>

<p>Hello Guy, I tried to use de pull function but I'm had some problems. When the another workbook was into &ldquo;C:&rdquo; the function worked, but I have workbooks in a server, (H:, W:, F:) and when I used these workbooks that were into W: for exemple, the function didn't work. The result was an error #REF. What can I do? Thanks.</p>

<p>This seems to be a very elegant solution - you can use an automatic procedure on Worksheet Change to update the name reference if the control cells which build the reference change - that would let you have multiple different names driven off changes in the same WS. I knew that names don't have to refer to a cell or to a range but can refer to anything including text or entire file paths (which I have used in the past) but had not made the jump to have them dynamically update like this. You learn something new every day&hellip;</p>

<p>Simplified, yet again. Here, there is no need to add the ThisWorkbook_Open() method; the function checks if the object exists and creates one if it doesn't. Paste this into a new VBA module in your Excel workbook. Watch for character translations that may have occurred due to pasting in the website: &lsquo;Requires filename, sheetname as first argument and cell reference as second argument &lsquo;Usage: type in an excel cell -&gt; =getvalue(A1,B1) &lsquo;Example of A1 -&gt; C:\TEMP\[FILE1.XLS]SHEET1&rsquo; &lsquo;Example of B1 -&gt; B3 &lsquo;This will fetch contents of cell (B3) located in (sheet1) of (c:\temp\file1.xls) &lsquo;Create a module and paste the code into the module (e.g. Module1, Module2) Public xlapp As Object Private Function getvalue(ByVal filename As String, ref As String) As Variant ' Retrieves a value from a closed workbook Dim arg As String Dim path As String Dim file As String Dim count As Integer filename = Trim(filename) path = Mid(filename, 1, InStrRev(filename, &ldquo;\&quot;)) file = Mid(filename, InStr(1, filename, &ldquo;[&quot;) + 1, InStr(1, filename, &ldquo;]&quot;) - InStr(1, filename, &ldquo;[&quot;) - 1) If Dir(path &amp; file) = &quot;&rdquo; Then getvalue = &ldquo;File Not Found&rdquo; Exit Function End If If xlapp Is Nothing Then &lsquo;Object must be created only once and not at each function call. Do not enable Set xlapp = CreateObject(&ldquo;Excel.application&rdquo;) End If ' Create the argument arg = &ldquo;'&rdquo; &amp; filename &amp; &ldquo;'!&rdquo; &amp; Range(ref).Range(&ldquo;A1&rdquo;).Address(, , xlR1C1) &lsquo;Execute an XLM macro getvalue = xlapp.ExecuteExcel4Macro(arg) End Function</p>

<p>Hi! Will anyone know if the PULL function would works for dynamic name range reference to a closed workbook? The name range is for example &lsquo;[Data.xlsx]Leads&rsquo;!$B$5:$B$23742 and the row number 23742 would change according to the last row of data in the closed workbook hence I need it to be dynamic and still able to use it within Sumproduct formula. Any help would be great!!</p>

<p>Rex, your final function is awesome. Easy to use (other than the many copy-paste issues) and absurdly fast compared to Harlan's pull function. Just wanted to say thanks, it saved me on a project that would have been impractically slow using the other method.</p>

<p>Rex, Would you be able to post and link to a .txt file with this function? Having difficulty and I think it likely has to do with copying/pasting from the wordpress comment.</p>
