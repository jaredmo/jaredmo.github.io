This holding reverses a rare taxpayer win on the issue of Son of BOSS tax shelters in which a district court had allowed the taxpayer to deduct losses from the investment.">

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that a taxpayer’s investment in a “Son of BOSS” tax shelter lacked economic substance and therefore did not generate deductible losses. This holding reverses a rare taxpayer win on the issue of Son of BOSS tax shelters in which a district court had allowed the taxpayer to deduct losses from the investment. The taxpayer invested in a so-called Son of Boss shelter called the Deerhurst Program by acquiring a combination of long and short foreign currency options and contributing them to a short-lived partnership. Upon liquidating the partnership, the taxpayer claimed a tax loss of more than $60 million, offsetting $60 million of income for the tax year, and he reported owing no federal taxes for the year. After amending his return, the taxpayer ended up claiming a $24 million refund for the tax year&hellip;</p>
