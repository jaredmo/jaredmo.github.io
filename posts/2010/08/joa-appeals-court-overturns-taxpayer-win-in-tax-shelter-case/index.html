<meta name="twitter:description" content="Most people wouldn&#39;t root for the IRS in a court case, but I&#39;m glad to see this decision. How long before we see &ldquo;Grandson of BOSS&rdquo; tax shelter schemes?
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that a taxpayer’s investment in a “Son of BOSS” tax shelter lacked economic substance and therefore did not generate deductible losses. This holding reverses a rare taxpayer win on the issue of Son of BOSS tax shelters in which a district court had allowed the taxpayer to deduct losses from the investment."/>

        <p>Most people wouldn't root for the IRS in a court case, but I'm glad to see <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Web/20103133.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+JournalOfAccountancy+%28Journal+of+Accountancy%29">this decision</a>. How long before we see &ldquo;Grandson of BOSS&rdquo; tax shelter schemes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that a taxpayer’s investment in a “Son of BOSS” tax shelter lacked economic substance and therefore did not generate deductible losses. This holding reverses a rare taxpayer win on the issue of Son of BOSS tax shelters in which a district court had allowed the taxpayer to deduct losses from the investment. The taxpayer invested in a so-called Son of Boss shelter called the Deerhurst Program by acquiring a combination of long and short foreign currency options and contributing them to a short-lived partnership. Upon liquidating the partnership, the taxpayer claimed a tax loss of more than $60 million, offsetting $60 million of income for the tax year, and he reported owing no federal taxes for the year. After amending his return, the taxpayer ended up claiming a $24 million refund for the tax year&hellip;</p>
