      <div class="post-content">
        
        <p>Last week, I was listening to a podcast called <a href="http://twit.tv/sn"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Now!</a> (which you should check out by the way). Steve Gibson, the host, mentioned a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179564/Virus_writers_are_picking_up_new_Microsoft_attack"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently discovered Windows vulnerability</a> that has been present in the OS going back 10+ years. Needless to say this was a little concerning that a vulnerability could exist for so long without being noticed, much less patched.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/20100802/bs_nf/74545"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has since rolled out a patch that plugs the hole</a>, but the question remains, &ldquo;Should I be surfing the web in the same OS I use to manage my finances and other sensitive info?&rdquo; I mean&hellip;seriously Microsoft, how many other holes are still out there waiting to be exploited. I feel like I am getting critical patch updates a couple times per month. That&rsquo;s a little ridiculous.</p>
<p>One of the suggestions Gibson made for the super-paranoid (a.k.a. Me) was to handle routine web surfing via a Linux USB stick, only booting into Windows to use Windows applications and surf trusted sites. I&rsquo;ve only had marginal experience with Linux, but I thought, what the heck I&rsquo;ll give it a shot. Turns out&hellip;I love it. Next choice was to pick a flavor. Linux has about a gazillion, but I opted for <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu 10.4</a>. Ubuntu seems to be branding itself as Linux for people who are scared of Linux. It has a nice GUI, and isn&rsquo;t intimidating at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, before booting I half expected to see an old school DOS-esque command line pop up (I&rsquo;m not scared of the command line, but people, it&rsquo;s not 1995 anymore). However, it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all. It is minimalism at its best which is perfect, since all I need is a secure way to browse the web without worrying some &ldquo;haxor&rdquo; is going to keylog my bank password. An additional benefit is I now have a secure way to surf the web from any public computer. Shut down, plug in the USB key, reboot, bingo-bango secure web browsing. So, now all my Apple friends can mock me and call me paranoid. In the meantime, I won&rsquo;t be worrying about the next vulnerabilty.</p>
