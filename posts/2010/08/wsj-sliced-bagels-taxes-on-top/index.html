        <p>The WSJ had an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704340504575448033463314628.html?mod=e2tw">interesting article today</a> about a quirk in New York&rsquo;s sales tax code. Under current rules, prepared foods are taxed at a higher rate than unprepared foods. On the surface this seems logical. Rich people eat out, poor people don&rsquo;t, and if the goal is a progressive tax system, this would seem a reasonable distinction. The problem then becomes how one defines a prepared food versus unprepared.</p>
<p>In the case of bagels, New York tax collectors have gotten very specific: sliced equals prepared and unsliced, unprepared. Sound crazy? You&rsquo;re not the only one. Up until now, the law has largely been unenforced, but apparently the State&rsquo;s coffers are so depleted they are beginning to collect and Bruegger&rsquo;s is the first target. I remember learning about this law in state tax class during my MACC program, so the distinction has been in existence since at least 2005. If this is not a prime example of bright line rules taken to the verge of the ridiculous, I don&rsquo;t know what is. So, bagel shops, don&rsquo;t slice that bagel unless you&rsquo;re willing to collect the extra tax from your customers. Just give them a knife so they can do it themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the tax on a bagel? It depends how you slice it—or in the case of New York, if you slice it. State tax officials, under orders from cash-strapped Albany to ramp up their audit and compliance efforts, have begun to enforce one of the more obscure distinctions within the state&rsquo;s sales tax law. In New York, the sale of whole bagels isn&rsquo;t subject to sales tax. But the tax does apply to &ldquo;sliced or prepared bagels (with cream cheese or other toppings),&rdquo; according to the state Department of Taxation and Finance. And if the bagel is eaten in the store, even if it&rsquo;s never been touched by a knife, it&rsquo;s also taxed.</p>
