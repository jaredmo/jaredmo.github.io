        <p>This is normally an accounting blog, but, (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve figured out) I am also a bit of a tech geek. Recently, I got my first real smartphone, a Motorola Droid. The Droid has been a game changer for me and I really can&rsquo;t imagine where this technology will be in another 5-10 years. That said, I thought I would throw my two cents in regarding my top five favorite apps I have come across so far.</p>
<ol>
<li>Twidroyd - This is far and away the best Twitter app I have found. It&rsquo;s humorous they recently had to change the name from &ldquo;Twidroid&rdquo; to &ldquo;Twidroyd&rdquo; so George Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t sue them. That one letter apparently makes a huge difference. On another note, if you aren&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jmonger"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following me on Twitter</a>, you should be.</li>
<li>MLB At Bat - So, I am a big St. Louis Cardinals fan. This app allows me to follow every game no matter where I am. It&rsquo;s a little pricey at $15, but that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for hearing the crowd roar after Pujols pounds another home run.</li>
<li>Google Listen - I started listening to podcasts back in 2005. Since then I, like most people, have been downloading them to iTunes and then syncing to my iPod. No longer. This app allows you to manage all your podcast subscriptions on your phone. No syncing required. Subscriptions are then dynamically added to your Google Reader account so you can listen on your computer should you prefer. It&rsquo;s like podcast nirvana.</li>
<li>Remember The Milk - The best to-do list manager out there. Enough said.</li>
<li>Andricious - Delicious is a social bookmarking service that allows users to tag webpages. Over the last five years it has become one of those things that I could not function without. It&rsquo;s my own personal directory of all things awesome. This app now lets me take all my bookmarks with me wherever I go.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to share if you have others you would add to the list.</p>
