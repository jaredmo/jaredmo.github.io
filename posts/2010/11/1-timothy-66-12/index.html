        <p>Written 2 millennia ago; relevant today. Human nature does not change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment, <strong>for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world.</strong> But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 1 Timothy 6:6-12 ESV</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 11/24/10:</strong><br>
One more quote on money that informs how I view possessions and their role in my life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die: Remove far from me falsehood and lying; <strong>give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the LORD?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.</strong> Proverbs 30:7-9 ESV</p>
</blockquote>
