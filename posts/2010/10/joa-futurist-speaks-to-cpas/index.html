<blockquote>
<p>Snyder listed seven economic inevitabilities for the next seven to eight years. Those are: * The entry-level labor pool will shrink by 5%. Workers 16 to 24 years old will be in short supply with intense competition among employers to attract this more tech-savvy generation. * The share of the work force held by individuals 55 and over will increase from 20% to 30%. * Unemployment will remain above 7.5%. * Fiscal and financial deleveraging will constrain government and consumer spending. * Commerce will become essentially paperless and cashless. * Health care will account for a quarter of all economic growth even as the health care industry consolidates. * The construction industry will shrink and consolidate.</p>
