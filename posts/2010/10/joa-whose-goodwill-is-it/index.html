<meta name="twitter:description" content="This is interesting. Not sure I agree with the ruling. However, my father is a dentist who&rsquo;s owned his practice for 25&#43; years, so I&rsquo;m a little biased.
 The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington recently held that goodwill created while a dentist was employed by his solely owned corporation belonged to the corporation and not to him. As a result, the dentist was required to characterize as a corporate dividend rather than a long-term capital gain the amount he received for the goodwill from the sale of his practice."/>
