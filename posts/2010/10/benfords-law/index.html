<p>What, equations don&rsquo;t do it for you? Well then, let&rsquo;s dive in. Benford&rsquo;s Law is one of those things that can be proven mathematically, but flies in the face of common sense. People have tried to explain the mechanics, but to me it&rsquo;s like gravity. Nobody really understands it. We just know it works. It states that in large, non-standard, real life tables of numbers (i.e. water bills, death rates, bank amounts), there is a pattern. Sounds very ominous doesn&rsquo;t it? For any given dataset, 1 is the first digit around 30% of the time. Subsequent leading digits appear in descending probability, with 9 occurring as the first digit less than 5% of the time. Here&rsquo;s a picture (for you honey).</p>
<p>[<img src="https://www.jmonger.com/images/2010-10-16-BenfordsLaw_800.gif"></p>
<p>This has all sorts of implications in the real world. It means that if you take a large enough dataset and compare the leading digits to Benford&rsquo;s Law, there should be a close match. If not, it is likely that human tampering of the data has occurred. This is one of the tests that gives auditors the warm-fuzzies. Fraudsters, when they tamper with data, tend to use the same leading digit or a random assortment of leading digits. For example, say you have an evil staff accountant who makes a large number of small dollar revenue entries that, when aggregated, inflate revenue by a material amount. Normal substantive tests may not catch this fraud because each entry by itself is immaterial. However, because people tend to reuse leading digits in repetitive tasks, the clerk&rsquo;s entries likely would cause the data not to conform to Benford&rsquo;s law, thus allowing the auditor to identify the fraud. Well, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for tonight. I&rsquo;m glad we could have this talk.</p>
