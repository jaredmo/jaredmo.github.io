The technology for strong encryption already exists. It&rsquo;s math. Bad guys will still use it. Backdoor mandates will only hurt law abiding citizens. If this passes as requested by law enforcement, secure peer-to-peer communication would become illegal and the systems that support it subject to redesign.">

        <p>Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte did a <a href="http://twit.tv/sn268"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great podcast</a> this week regarding the Obama administration&rsquo;s proposed crypto-backdoor legislation. This is same issue Schneier discussed in his <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/09/wiretapping_the.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> from last week. Here are my takeaways.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technology for strong encryption already exists. It&rsquo;s math. Bad guys will still use it. Backdoor mandates will only hurt law abiding citizens.</li>
<li>If this passes as requested by law enforcement, secure peer-to-peer communication would become illegal and the systems that support it subject to redesign. This includes corporate VPNs, Skype, and a host of other communication services.</li>
<li>Backdoors would only serve to open security holes that hackers can step through to cause problems for honest people.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/fbi-backdoors/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a> and the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/government-seeks"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EFF</a> also did pieces on the story that are worth reading. I can&rsquo;t see this making it far in the legislature, but stranger things have happened.</p>
<p><strong>Update 10/6/10:</strong> Reread the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times article</a> that started this whole conversation. The final FBI quote is so misguided that I had to comment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one should be promising their customers that they will thumb their nose at a U.S. court order,” Ms. Caproni said. “They can promise strong encryption. They just need to figure out how they can provide us plain text.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole point of encryption is that no one but the two authenticated parties can decrypt the data. If companies can decrypt their client&rsquo;s data then by definition the product is not providing strong encryption. I understand the FBI&rsquo;s dilemma, but they really need to rethink their position. CPAs should watch this issue unfold as it has the potential to dramatically change the IT landscape.</p>
