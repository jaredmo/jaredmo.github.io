        <p>It is always nice to read an <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2007/12/17/daily57.html?ana=from_rss">article like this</a> about your profession. Robert Half International has come up with these salary estimates for the following accounting/finance positions in 2008.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Internal auditor. National average starting salaries for internal audit managers at large companies (more than $250 million in sales) are expected to climb 6.7 percent in 2008, to a range of $81,500 to $109,500 annually.</em></li>
<li><em>Senior accountant. The greatest gains in starting compensation for senior accountants are expected at midsize companies ($25 million to $250 million in sales), with starting salaries projected to rise 5.4 percent over 2007 levels, to between $49,250 and $63,000 per year, on average.</em></li>
<li><em>Hedge fund accountant. Professionals who possess three to seven years of experience in fund administration or investment management will see starting salaries rise 6.5 percent, to a range of $46,250 to $64,500.</em></li>
<li><em>Financial analyst. Base pay is forecast to jump 5.8 percent for managers with large companies to between $74,750 and $99,000. Average starting salaries for entry-level professionals at large companies are expected to rise 6.9 percent, to between $38,250 and $47,500 annually.</em></li>
<li><em>Public accountant. Average salaries are projected to increase 7.7 percent to between $88,250 and $129,250. At small firms (up to $25 million in sales), professionals with one to three years of experience can expect a 7.7 percent increase in average starting salaries, to a range of $44,750 to $53,250.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of us aren&rsquo;t paid like doctors or attorneys these numbers would seem to bode well for the future of the profession. This just proves my belief that the world will always need people with mad ten-key skills.</p>
