        <p>Last month, my family and I made a trip to Florida to visit my mom&rsquo;s parents. We had a great visit and while I was there, my grandmother offered to let me have some books from grandfather&rsquo;s study. Grandpa was an engineer turned businessman, and spent his career building things: first automotive parts, then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/02/business/company-news-stanadyne-accepts-bid-by-forstmann-little.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder value</a>.</p>
<p>He had some great accounting textbooks from his MBA at University of Chicago in the 1960&rsquo;s. While accountants have an inordinate number of standards now compared to the 60&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s amazing how little the fundamentals have changed in 50 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jmonger.com/images/2011-02-13-IMG_7045.jpeg" ><img src="https://www.jmonger.com/images/2011-02-13-IMG_7045.jpeg?w=300" title="Accounting textbooks"></a></p>
<p>He also had the one below on computers. The copyright date is 1961, and most of the text has to do with punch cards and vacuum tubes. It&rsquo;s really an engineering book, and to be honest I don&rsquo;t understand half of the material, but I love old technical books like this. The last chapter is called &ldquo;A Computer in Your Home&rdquo; and begins like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although some of today&rsquo;s computers cost over $1 million each, we suggest that someday it might be possible to have a computer in every home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that prediction came true. It was likely beyond the author&rsquo;s comprehension that not only would we have a computer in every home, but in every pocket.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jmonger.com/images/2011-02-13-IMG_7044.jpeg" ><img src="https://www.jmonger.com/images/2011-02-13-IMG_7044.jpeg?w=300" title="IMG_7044"></a></p>
<p>It then goes on to provide detailed technical instructions on how you can build your own home computer. Looks a little different than what we use today.</p>

<p>Grandma also gave me Grandpa&rsquo;s original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slide rule</a> from when he was an engineering student at University of Michigan in the 1940&rsquo;s. These were the days before the digital calculators we all take for granted, and it&rsquo;s an amazing device. I have no idea how to use it, but I plan to learn someday. The leather case has his name and dorm address written on the side. When I look at it, I imagine a 20-year-old version of my grandfather plugging away at his homework, trying to finish so he can take my Grandma on a date.</p>

<p>This post makes me so happy, especially to share that image of Grandma and Grandpa as young 20-somethings so in love. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine since they still love each other so deeply and wonderfully!</p>
